Information:

Hole Bodies

Annie Yuchen Song explores the theme of discomfort using mixed mediums. The work draws references to the exquisite corpse, where the composition of the materials each represent a part of the body that feels dreamlike. The mediums she uses allude to taboo themes that explore the malleability of the outer body and the inner psychological space. Please note: Trocadero Art Space is accessed via two flights of stairs.
