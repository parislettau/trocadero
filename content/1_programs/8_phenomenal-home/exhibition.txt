Information: Phenomenal Home is a series of works that investigate the idea of the human body as a home. By externalising internal negotiations of the mind/body divide, the works bring into question what it means to be ‘at home’ with oneself. The works also reflect the external physical home as an extension of a human subject, drawing attention to the performance of the union between mind, body, and home. Foremost it is a celebration of bodies, particularly agender and transgender peoples and queer connection.
