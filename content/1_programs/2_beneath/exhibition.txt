Information:

‘Beneath’​ looks at the concept of home, and how the places where we are raised plays a role in the construction of identity. How does a label like ‘Australian’ bring about feelings of guilt and restlessness?

Having to embrace the ‘Australian larrikin’ narrative creates a feeling of personal unease; it reinforces an undercurrent of social injustices. This feeling is further exacerbated by a nation-wide reluctance to face the history from which modern Australia benefits. ‘B​eneath’ ​reflects on these unsettling feelings I often shy away from, but am forced to confront in the places I call home.

Please note: Trocadero Art Space is accessed via two flights of stairs.
