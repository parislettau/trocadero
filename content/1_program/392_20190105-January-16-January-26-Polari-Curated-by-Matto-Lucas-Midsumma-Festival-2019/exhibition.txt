Polari / Midsumma Festival 2019

 A specially curated visual art exhibition for Midsumma Festival 2019 Presented by: Trocadero Artspace, Curated by Matto Lucas 'Polari' brings together a selection of local, interstate and international queer artists whose practices explore methods of communication within a range of various media and visual practices. Polari - meaning 'to talk' - is a form of secret, theatrical slang language used primarily by homosexual men at a time when homosexuality was criminalised, to conceal homosexuality from hostile outsiders. Incorporating illustration, animation, video, installation, performance, photography and experimental media, the 'Polari' group exhibition attempts to playfully explore the ways in which queer contemporary visual artists interpret and divulge their conceptual frameworks and meanings. In what ways are our works seen as "gay art" or are we "queer practitioners" and how do we disclose our messages to patrons via our art practices?
