*Outside the Box* is a four-part conversation series that sets out to explore and celebrate cultural shifts influenced by diverse creators in Australia.

Presenter &amp; Special Program Curator Wintana Kidane will take the audience on an intimate journey through the stories of inspirational black and Indigenous creators, artists and businesspeople.

This series is a unique opportunity to get to know local creators and connect with the local community. Together, we hold a space for storytelling and conversations that both inspire and challenge our perspectives. These conversations are about identity, ownership, representation and building sustainable communities.

Wintana Kidane is an African Australian podcaster, presenter and the co-creator of the [Bittersweet Podcast](https://thebittersweetpodcast.libsyn.com/). She is Trocadero's Special Programs Curator.
