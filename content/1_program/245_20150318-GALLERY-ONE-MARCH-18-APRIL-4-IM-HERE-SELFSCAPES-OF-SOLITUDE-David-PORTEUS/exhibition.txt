Text: ### Gallery One 

David PORTEUS *I'm Here, Selfscapes of Solitude* My photographs are original but accessible works of beauty, framed and arranged to evoke a unique point-of-view. With a background in music composition and sound design I see these images as poems or songs celebrating solitude in the Australian landscape, creating a new world for me and hopefully the observer. I have previously featured form and colour in my music composition practise and have extended this approach to visual art. Colour, composition and movement are explored as mediums, evoking a collection of stories that say “I'm Here!” The subjects of these works are not models but people who have experienced solitude, their collaboration on ideas adds an authenticity and sense of play that cannot be scripted.
