Daniel R Marks   
*Drone/Container*

*Drone/Container* is an evolving workspace. The box-like dimensions of Trocaderoâ€™s Project Space facilitate material boundaries which are continuously pushed, pulled, punctured, cut, stained, destabilised and redistributed by a series of performance actions. These actions will occur intermittently over the course of the exhibition, and are scored by a collection of instructional text snippets and diagrams. The artist-performer takes on the role of the *Drone*: a subject operating in adherence to these surrounding codes. The Project Space is the *Container*: an impermanent border of object and artefact surrounding the subjective body. In the mutual transference of agency between *Drone* and *Container*, their respective skins are fractured, bled and intersected.
