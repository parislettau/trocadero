*Closer Together / Further Away*

‘Closer together/ Further away’ aims to explore the complex emotional states we experience in daily life, especially in our intimate relationships. The work attempts to capture and preserve moments of intimacy that are, like all things inevitably fleeting and susceptible to change in the constant flux of life. What remains are remnants; belongings, imbued with their own lived meaning, fragments of memories that become a dream, longing to be remembered.
