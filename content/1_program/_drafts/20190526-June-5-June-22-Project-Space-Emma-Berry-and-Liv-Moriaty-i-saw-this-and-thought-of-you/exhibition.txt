Emma Berry and Liv Moriarty *i saw this and thought of you* Simultaneously lead, copy, follow. Each act is improvised and tangential; an attempt at synchronicity through assumptions.

A choreography is created through negotiation and vulnerability. Read lips, eye-contact and body language become a conduit for exchange, as the artists attempt to push, pull and balance their own intuition in relation to one another.

In an effort to push hierarchical barriers and transfer knowledge, a considered playfulness develops into a complex kinship. Like a trust fall exercise, only both are falling and catching at the same time, and then all at once, it becomes a dance.
