Taylah Kelly *\#internetprincess*I’ve always been interested the ideals of beauty and especially in the age of Instagram and the iPhone. #internetprincess revolves around the self and the digitalised image relating to the anxieties fuelled by social media. I’ve created my own living breathing Insta-persona #internetprincess @officalinternetprincess, a self obsessed narcissistic beauty blogger who exists inside Instagram. Internetprincess loves her selfie stick and a moisturising face mask is essential, she is totally obsessed with Instagram, hashtags and trendy internet slang. Internetprincess is a hot mess cliché fusion of youtubers/Instagram influencers normalising body modification and the pressure of beauty ideals within social media.
