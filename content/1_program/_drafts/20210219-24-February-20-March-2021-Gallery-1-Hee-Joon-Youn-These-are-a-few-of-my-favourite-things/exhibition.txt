To obsess is to return, time after time, to a thought, object, practice. Obsession’s fierce and unapologetic project is to fix in time, to rage against the constant flux of matter and hold a space of consistency for as long as desire allows. In ‘These are a few of my favourite things’ Madeleine Minack, Kaijern Koo, Hee Joon Youn, Skye Malu Baker and Nina Rose Prendergast take obsession as a central thematic, formal and material concern. After a year ruled by wild unpredictability and temporal strangeness, what is it we seek to grip on to?
