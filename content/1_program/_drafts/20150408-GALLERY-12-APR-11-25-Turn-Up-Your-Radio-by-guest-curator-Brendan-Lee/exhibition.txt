**Turn Up Your Radio: Curated by Brendan Lee**
----------------------------------------------

Saturday April 11 - Saturday April 25 OPENING Saturday APRIL 11, 4 – 6pm Turn Up Your Radio is an exciting new exhibition curated by Brendan Lee presenting artworks by some of Australia’s most influential musicians who are also professional visual artists. The exhibition includes members of Macromantics, Ratcat, Beaches, Dick Diver, Cosmic Psychos, and the The Dirty Three, along with solo artists such as Darren Sylvester. The exhibition includes a cross section of emerging to established visual artists who have developed a creatively important musical career. Turn Up Your Radio questions the reading of artworks by influential artists with musical outputs by exploring the dynamics and the challenges of both mediums and how this versatility opens up challenging observations of contemporary Australian culture. A playlist of songs selected by each artist will accompany the show along with a text written by Vincent Alessi, Curator at the Ian Potter Museum.
