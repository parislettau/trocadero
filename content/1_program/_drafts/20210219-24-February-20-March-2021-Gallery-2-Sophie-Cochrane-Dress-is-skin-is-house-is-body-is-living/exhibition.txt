Gallery 2  
  
24 February – 20 March 2021  
Opening night: Wednesday 24 February, 6pm – 8pm

‘Dress Is Skin Is House Is Body Is Living’ seeks to reimagine housing as assemblages of bodies. In asking what the difference between a house and a home is, it questions the structure and materials - bricks, cement - typically associated with houses. Dress responds to being away from home, feelings of closeness and of being far away. Through the close crop focusing on the dressing rather than identities, Dress seeks to document a Deleuzian ‘becoming’. Be- coming-together, becoming-house, becoming-home.
