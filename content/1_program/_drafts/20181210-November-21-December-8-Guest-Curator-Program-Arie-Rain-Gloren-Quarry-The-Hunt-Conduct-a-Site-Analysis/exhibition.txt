 "*Quarry" The Hunt Conduct a Site Analysis*

 Over the past two months, horror performance group The Hunt have been analysing an 86,000 sqm quarry in the Gudabanud country/Otway Ranges, asking “why might his site cause fear in people?” They have been wading knee deep in snake-infested swamps, crawling in dark holes, collecting animal bones and documenting carcasses. They have been mining the psychology of this place, this deep pit, for which horror has been extracted. What can this horror performance group tell us about this site, that an architect or urban designer might overlook? Enter a live research document in the form of an exhibition of installation and performances that will make the hair on your neck stand up. ---

The Hunt are an award winning, multidisciplinary group of artists who use sound, performance and imagery to create performance vignettes that draw on horror tropes in film, fashion and literature. The core artists in the group are: Christopher Gray (Music Director), Bridget Mackey (Performance Director) and Grace Purton-Long (Art Director) they create work based on their individual experiences in the music, theatre and design worlds. Since forming in 2016, The Hunt have presented work at private parties, music venues, site specific locations, and in galleries around Melbourne. The Hunt’s performance ‘Woman in Car’ won the Melbourne Fringe Festival 2017 Liveworks Experimental Art Award, supported by Performance Space.
