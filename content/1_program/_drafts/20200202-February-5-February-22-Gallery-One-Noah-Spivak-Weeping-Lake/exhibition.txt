Noah Spivak   
*Weeping Lake*  
   
Weeping Lake investigates the liminal space between narcissism and self-loathing. The hand silvered glass that surrounds you is made via a process involving the mixing of photographic silver nitrate and other various chemistry. These far from perfect “mirrors” reflect and disillusion both the physical and mental space of their admirers – reminding each of us of our own fragile dance with confidence and criticism. This exhibition aims to provide a space for the viewer and artist alike to consider the value of (self)image in our visually saturated culture.

 Please note: Trocadero Art Space is accessed via two flights of stairs.
