*I Want to Believe*

 I Want to Believe explores the folklore behind UFO sightings and their relationship to the era of film photography. A collaboration between two artists, the show manifests the intense nature of obsessive UFO believers while both critiquing and fangirling on the cult of UFO culture. From Roswell to Westall, I Want to Believe explores hoax photography at its most defining moments in the 20th century.
