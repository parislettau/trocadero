Text: ***Session*** is the title of the upcoming exhibition at Trocadero Art Space in Footscray. The exhibition is the first in an annual series at Trocadero looking at different cultures from within. *Session* is presented by skateboarders about skateboarding. The exhibition transfers the skateboarding terminology into a gallery context offering an inclusive model of discourse. In ‘skate talk’ a session is based around a location where disparate groups and individuals would congregate with surety that others will be there. As opposed to the drug or alcohol application of the term - in skate circles - sessions are inclusive and are vital in the culture’s progression. Artists of various mediums and styles will be having a session, offering a unique critique and reflection of what would normally be kept out of the mainstream or glorified as fashion. Tattoos, photographs, and sculptures all form a cohesive glimpse into a lifestyle that was not-so-long-ago deemed worthy of society’s miscreants.
