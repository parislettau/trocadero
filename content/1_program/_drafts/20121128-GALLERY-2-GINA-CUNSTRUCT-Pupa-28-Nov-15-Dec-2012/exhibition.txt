Text: Pupa is a work that focuses on the fears we experience about our lives as flesh. During this live performance I will create a transformative, protective space for myself; both a chrysalis and a womb. This work plays on ideas of interior and exterior, desire, revulsion and the dismemberment of the bodies of animals.
