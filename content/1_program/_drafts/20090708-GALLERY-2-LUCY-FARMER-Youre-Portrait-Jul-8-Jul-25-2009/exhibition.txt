Text: In this body of work, I have created figurative art works that investigate a personal attitude to class and value in a contemporary Western Culture. What I strive to achieve is to create an experience where the act of gazing at/participating with/ 'audiencing'a work is mirrored back to the audience, in an attempt to highlight the necessity of their critiquing /judging the works.
