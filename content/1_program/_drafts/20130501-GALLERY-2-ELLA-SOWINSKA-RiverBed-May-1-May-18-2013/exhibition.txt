Text: **RiverBed**

Over the past few years I have used a friend of mine, Daniel, as the subject of my practice. The fact that I can get away with almost anything means that I will do almost anything to him, his space or his belongings. I have often pushed the boundaries of our friendship, investigated ideas of power and questioned societyâ€™s ideas of what is right and what is wrong.

My work for Trocadero Art Space has taken a more romantic turn. I have suspended two television sets from the roof of the exhibition space showing two alternate views of Daniel towing his bed down a river with a canoe whist I lay peacefully sleeping in the bed.
