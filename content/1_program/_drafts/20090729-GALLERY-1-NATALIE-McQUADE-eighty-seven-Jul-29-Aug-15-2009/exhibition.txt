Text: Questions of perception in time and space – reconfiguring the everyday. Three different configurations of eighty-seven stereoscope cards in Gallery One over three weeks. My work traverses sculpture, installation and sound in a site-responsive, site-inspired practice. I investigate a continuity between making and experiencing – isolating and amplifying elements in everyday objects and experiences to elicit recognition in combination with unfamiliarity. I am interested in cusps of things – intersections,thresholds, meeting points – points at which a person's perception can be questioned, shifting awareness between the spatial and temporal realms and dissolving the distinction between the two.
