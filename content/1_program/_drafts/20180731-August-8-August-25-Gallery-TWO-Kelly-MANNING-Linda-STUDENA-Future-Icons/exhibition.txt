Kelly Manning and Linda Studena

*Future Icons*

This show is a presentation of two bodies of work that together question our notions of security and current politics. Kelly Manning exhibits a M-ON-U-MENT-AL installation come utopian squat, using printmaking and neon light, while Linda Studena explores the enigma of the winged sphinx through photography, print and collage. Future Icons is a meeting of worlds in an alluring tale, equally menacing and hopeful.
