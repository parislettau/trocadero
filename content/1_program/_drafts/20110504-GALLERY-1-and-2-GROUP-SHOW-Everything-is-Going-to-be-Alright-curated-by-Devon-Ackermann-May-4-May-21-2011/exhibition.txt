Text: *Everything Is Going To Be Alright* is a playfully reflective exhibition inviting artist to engage with and question notions of stability surrounding cultural understandings of text, language and identity. Offering up a complex discrepancy betwee variable 'truths' the artists arrive at a knotted conclusions inextricably linked to their examinations of form and content, humour and substance, hope and hopelessness.
