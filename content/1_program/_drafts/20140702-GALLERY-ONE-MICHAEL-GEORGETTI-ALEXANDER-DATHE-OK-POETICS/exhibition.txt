Text: GALLERY ONE Michael GEORGETTI &amp; ALEXANDER DATHE *Ok Poetics*

"This project examines the role of intervention in contemporary art through the use of installation, painting and sculpture. Using found and ready made objects we aim to expand upon the mediating space between the hand of the artist and the canvas in order to create new readings of authorship and to convey the performative role of gesture used in painting. The project will involve absurdity and humour to create analogies of art making processes. Through assemblage we call upon the viewer to re-interpret the objects that make up our everyday world and in doing so we wish to link the social, political and economic systems of contemporary visual culture to a multidimensional form of painting practice."
