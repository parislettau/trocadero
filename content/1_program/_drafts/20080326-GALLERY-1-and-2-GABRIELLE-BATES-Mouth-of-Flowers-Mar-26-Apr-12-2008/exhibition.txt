Text: Mouth of Flowers includes experimental paintings, sculptural objects and video - all created in the idyllic setting of "Rimbun Dahan", northwest of Kuala Lumpur. The works use figuratioin and southeast Asian Motifs to explore issues that confront artists in an increasingly non-permissive and silencing Malaysian political climate.
