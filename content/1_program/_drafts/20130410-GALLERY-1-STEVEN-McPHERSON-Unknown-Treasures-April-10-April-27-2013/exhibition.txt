Text: *A series of works that explore elemental ideas of creation and recurrence through rhythmic, geometric constructions of space that are both intimate and beguiling. Employing steel as a canvas, large drawings are crafted via acts of perceived destruction through a process of rusting, burning , burnishing and drawing directly on to the metal. The culmination is depictions of cavernous and unfamiliar spaces that allude to other worldly imagery of the cosmos, fractals and esoteric symbology.*
