It gets more complicated to separate the day-to-day experience from radical thought.   
  
My desire has never been to make art but to express something that I cannot recognise or understand.   
  
I believe that all my skills, knowledge and experience of the world are transferable, I never waste any opportunity to learn something new and shift.
