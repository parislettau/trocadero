Text: Whilst barren hills loom studded, blanketed with rock in the distance, behind me the arrangement of stone within the castle walls reveal subtle patterning. I begin to think about the ornamentation in the stone walls and how the rocks that define the undulating terrain are also a form of ornamentation on a grander scale.
