Phil Soliman

*Together*

 "Together" is a riotous and profoundly personal exploration of the artist's intersecting identities as a middle-class Egyptian-Australian queer man, and his fraught relationship with the various familial, social, cultural, political and religious groups he willingly or unwillingly inhabits. Their parallels and differences are presented with unflinching honesty and humour, across video, installation and performance.
