**About the artist**

Ivy Mutuku is is a Kenyan born, Melbourne multidisciplinary artist with a fire for visual storytelling. She uses her abilities to never tell us what to think, but simply presents life in a variety of beautiful, innocent, sensitive, varied, quiet, tragic, loud and above all genuine shades of nuance. Her work is the pinnacle of personal artistic integrity. She uses the opportunity of her creativity to visually deliver projects that not only educate; but give the viewer a glimpse into the beauty of the untold.
