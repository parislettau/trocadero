Всё Нормально (All is normal)  
Lachlan Horn

Playing in the spaces between language, memory, images and stories, I take pleasure in the simultaneous potential and inadequacy of words and the poetic spaces as they are pulled, pushed and spread around. Meaning is viscous. While its elements can be dismantled and rearranged, it moves reluctantly, it clings and sags in strands, and sometimes it gets stuck to things it shouldn’t.  
  
My practice drifts between video, sculpture, installation and printmaking. Reading informs a lot of my work and I often steal the good bits.

 Please note: Trocadero Art Space is accessed via two flights of stairs.
