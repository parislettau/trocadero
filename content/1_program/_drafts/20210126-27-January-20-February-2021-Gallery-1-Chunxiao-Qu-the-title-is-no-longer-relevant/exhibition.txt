Gallery 1  
Curated by Chelsea Hopper   
  
27 January – 20 February 2021  
Opening night: Wednesday 27 January, 6pm – 8pm

Chunxiao Qu is a Chinese native speaker, operating in the confines of English poetry in order to agitate our understanding of linguistic signifiers. Short bursts of neurotic speech are jotted down then reformulated into designs that are then fabricated in neon lighting through factories in her homeland she has developed a working bond with. By subverting capitalism’s mode of communication against itself, Chunxiao hopes to attack our internalised dogmatic structures.
