Jessie Adams *MIRAGE*

Returning from diverse landscapes across Australia and the deserts of the USA, Melbourne based photomedia artist Jessie Adams transforms three key natural phenomena - light, water and stone, through sumptuous digitally printed silk. Her photographs offer a visceral engagement with the three elements, challenging the static 2D nature of the photograph. *MIRAGE*, opening at Trocadero Art Space, harnesses the sculptural potential of Adamsâ€™ wearable art works, creating stunning visions of magical worlds.
