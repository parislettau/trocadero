Jessie Cunningham-Reid and Liam Power   

--------------------------------------------------------------------

  
In this project, Naarm/Melbourne-based artists Jessie Cunningham-Reid and Liam Power introduce some of their recent works and how their practice has evolved in response to lockdown. Through discussions spanning intimacy, alienation and the ubiquity of algorithms, these two artists reflect upon the possible conceptual content of their works as well as their practical applications.

*I have made all of these works in the last year from photographs and memory. These works consider the concept of a “Figure in Space” and the absence of figures to question the impact of the human gestalt. Through visual representation and the psychological tension generated through human intervention, landscapes and “figurative” works are painted democratically to investigate the impact of the perceived human form. Compositionally, I like to explore everyday scenes from my life, often choosing more mundane or unlikely compositions as an opportunity to challenge myself and incite creative resolutions.*

**Liam Power** is a multidisciplinary artist and creative coder who works with video, sound and data.

*My work primarily questions and critiques the boundaries of systems and their function in society. These systems could be computing technologies, perceptual and cognitive relations, or corporate surveillance techniques…Right now I'm working with augmenting photographic material within neural networks. I train an algorithm with a large dataset of images which can then begin to make inferences about their style and features. Holding the sum of these images in it's memory, the network can map these features to synthesise new content.*
