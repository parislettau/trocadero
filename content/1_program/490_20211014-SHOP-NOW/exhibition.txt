**Trocadero Prints**   
  
We are excited to bring you ten limited edition giclée prints, printed by [Hound &amp; Bone](https://www.houndandbone.com.au/). We have collaborated with a group of artists who we love, and who are an important part of Troc's history.   
  
Funds raised will go to establishing Trocadero's new space in 2022, and 10% of all profits will be donated to [Seed Mob](https://www.seedmob.org.au/).  
  
Contributing artists: Caoife Power, Chelsea Arnott, Chunxiao Qu, Georgia Banks, Josh Hattam, Klari Agar, Narinda Cook, Nicholas Burridge, Rachel Morley and Zara Sully.
