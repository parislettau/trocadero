Text: Trocadero Art Space is thrilled to present ‘the “F” word’, our annual fundraising event. In celebration, we are hosting an exhibition with a selection of works by our past and future exhibitors. Join us for our most anticipated fundraiser yet!

All funds raised from the sale of artwork, raffle tickets, drinks and donations will contribute directly to the flourishing of Trocadero in 2020. We encourage everyone to pop in, enjoy a drink, get to know our community of artists and - if the stars align - take the rare opportunity to purchase one of their works.

For nearly 15 years Trocadero has been a non-profit art space run by a dedicated committee of volunteer artists and arts workers. Trocadero strives to provide a safe and engaging environment for artists to exhibit in.

Trocadero Art Space gratefully acknowledges our generous supporters as well all our participating artists.
